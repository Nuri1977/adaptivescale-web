# Migrating your database to Snowflake with Open Source.

In this webinar we'll discuss some challenges with database migration and explore how we can leverage RosettaDB, Jupyter Notebooks, and Spark to migrate both database objects and the associated data.

We’ll discuss some of the challenges one typically faces with database migrations.  We’ll explore RosettaDB as an open source alternative to help solve some of these challenges,  and we’ll walk though an end-to-end demo of migrating both Postgres and MySQL databases to Snowflake.
