## Automating Schema & Data Migration with RosettaDB and Kinetica

Learn how you can leverage a modern DI stack for building "Data Products" with RosettaDB, Git and GitHub Actions. We partnered with Kinetica for this event to demonstrate how to build automated data pipelines for delivering data along with the requisite schema management.

This webinar was inspired by the blog:
 [Efficient Change Schema Capture (CSC) and Schema Translations with RosettaDB](/blogs/efficient-change-schema-capture-csc-and-schema-translations-with-rosettadb/)
