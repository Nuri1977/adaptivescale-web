To test the accuracy of your migrated data in RosettaDB, you can follow these general steps:

1. Define your expected results: Before performing any testing, define what the expected data results should be after migration.

2. Select a representative sample of data: Choose a representative sample of data from your source database that includes all types of data (e.g., text, numeric, date/time, etc.) and represents a typical use case.

3. Migrate the sample data: Use RosettaDB to migrate the selected sample data from your source database to the target database.

4. Verify the migrated data: Once the migration is complete, verify the migrated data in the target database against the expected results defined in step 1.

5. Perform additional testing: If necessary, perform additional testing on other parts of your data or with different sets of data.

6. Document your findings: Keep track of any issues or discrepancies found during testing, and document how they were resolved.

7. Repeat testing: After resolving any issues found during testing, repeat the testing process to ensure that the migration was successful and accurate.
